    <h2>A person I admire (past or present)</h2>
    <p class="person-description">
      I admire Chessie King, a British model, author, and artist.
      She's enormously body positive and is <span class="important-point">currently battling a heart condition</span> that she's had multiple invasive surgieries for.
      Despite that, she just had her first daughter and wrote a book this year!
